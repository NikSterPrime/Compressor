In the quiet village of Greenhollow, people often told stories of the old clock tower. The clock tower was tall, very tall, and its bell could be heard across the hills. Every morning the bell would ring, and every evening the bell would ring again. The children of the village would run around the tower, laughing, shouting, and playing games. The merchants would gather in the square, calling out their prices, calling out their wares, and calling out to travelers. 

The tower had stood for centuries. The tower had stood against storms, against rain, against wind, and against snow. The tower had watched people come, people go, people live, and people die. The tower had seen joy, sadness, hope, despair, and countless ordinary days. Some said the tower was alive. Some said the tower was watching. Some said the tower was waiting. 

Every traveler who passed through Greenhollow saw the clock, heard the bell, and felt the strange weight of time. The bell was loud, very loud, and the sound echoed in the heart. Some travelers loved the sound, some feared the sound, and some never forgot the sound. The bell was memory. The bell was history. The bell was a reminder.

On a cold winter morning, when the sky was gray, when the snow was deep, and when the wind was sharp, the bell did not ring. The villagers waited, the children waited, the merchants waited, but the bell did not ring. A silence spread across the square. A silence spread across the houses. A silence spread across the hills. The silence was heavy, and the silence was strange. 

Day after day, the bell did not ring. The tower stood, but the bell was silent. People whispered in the streets, people whispered in the inns, and people whispered by the fire. Was the tower broken? Was the bell broken? Or was time itself broken? The villagers did not know. The travelers did not know. No one knew.

Still, the tower stood. Still, the tower watched. Still, the tower waited. And in the silence, the people of Greenhollow wondered when, or if, the bell would ring again.
